I am a Principal Technical Writer with 15 years of experience in developer tools, APIs, admins and game engine documentation (UX/UI).

My strengths lie in simplifying complex systems, building relationships with product developers and users, driving documentation quality through workflow and tooling improvements, and leading docs-as-code transformations that make content more maintainable and integrated with product development. I have worked with end-to-end documentation strategies setting up DocOps for several products at King, implementing scalable, maintainable docs-as-code solutions using Git, static site generators, CI/CD and IDE-integrated workflows.

I am recognized for cross-functional collaboration with Engineering, Product, and Design to elevate documentation quality, user satisfaction, and developer enablement. Passionate about AI-enhanced authoring, workflow automation, and mentoring technical writers. Seeking continued growth in content strategy, product development, and team leadership.
